package commands

// Any template can be included into another template; assuming that
// you have not created a circular reference, this will not cause the
// compiler to loop but will instead cause the generated code to
// run into errors.
// When you are creating a template that will be included into another
// template, you can use the `@children` command to indicate where any
// optional content from the calling template should be inserted.
// The `@children` command is used in combination with the rendering
// code syntax `=`.
