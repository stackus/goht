// Variables and calls to functions that return values can be interpolated
// into the Goht templates.

var someVar = "Hello"

@goht InterpolateCode() {
	%p #{someVar}, World!
}

// Interpolation is not done within Go code or within a string literal.
@goht NoInterpolation() {
	%p Do the following; No interpolation is necessary.
	%p= someVar + ", World!"
	%p= "No interpolation is #{performed} here."
}

// Because the interpolation and tag id share the same starting character,
// a `#` you will need to escape the interpolation with a backslash when it
// is the first character of a line.
// This is only necessary when it is the first character of a line and not
// when it is the first character of text following a tag.

@goht EscapeInterpolation() {
	\#{someVar}, World!
	%p #{someVar}, World!
}

// There are also times when you want to ignore the interpolation and just
// print the text. This is also handled with the backslash.
// This can be done at the start of a line, after a tag or even mid-text.
//
// You will need to use two backslashes to escape the interpolation when
// it is at the start of a line. This is because the first backslash is
// triggering the parser to not interpret the next character as any
// kind of special character.
// This is also how you would escape a tag, id, or class character at the
// start of a line.
//
// All three of the following uses of "someVar" are not interpolated, and
// will render as "#{someVar}" in the final HTML.

@goht IgnoreInterpolation() {
	\\#{someVar}, World!
	%p
		\\#{someVar}, World!
	A greeting: \#{someVar}, World!
	\. this line begins with a period
	\# this line begins with a hash
	\% this line begins with a percent
}
